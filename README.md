Timer-based dungeon crawler RPG

Princess Pamela's evil stepmother Stacy locked Pamela in the dungeon, protected by a Dungeon Master! The community hires a mercenary to defeat the Dungeon Master and save the princess!

Move with arrow keys before the timer runs out! Every time you move, enemies move on a specific pattern.

Created in Unity for Game Design class. Our team of three included Clark Chambers, Molly Sulcer, and me.

All art is totally ripped from [Crypt of the NecroDancer](https://braceyourselfgames.com/crypt-of-the-necrodancer/).
